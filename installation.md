## Android

1. Clone repo
2. Install `NDK` under `SDK Tools` via your SDK Manager (likely in Android Studio, but maybe you do it another way)
3. You'll need CMake, so if you don't have it [download](https://cmake.org/download/) it and [install](https://cmake.org/install/) it
4. Download [OpenCV-Android SDK](https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-android/) and direct [Line 9 of CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/CompanyCam/companycam-camera/blob/puttingItAllTogether/android/app/CMakeLists.txt#L9) to your local copy
